# Creating-Form-in-HTML
You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action attribute on your form element.
# Add a Submit Button to a Form
Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with your form's action attribute.
# Use HTML5 to Require a Field
You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.

For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required within your input element, like this: <input type="text" required>
